## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

For this project, some main data science libraries were used and will be needed for properly running the notebook.

These are the libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn


## Data <a name="data"></a>

The data used for this project can be found here on this publicly available repository of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravduttakiit/loan-defaulter).


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The area of Loans has a really interesting machine learning problem which is predicting who has a defaulted loan based on the customer's characteristics. This motivated me to pursue the answer to the following questions.

* Which type of contract is the most defaulted?
* How the default behavior is divided across the customer's social context.
* What are the factors that most relate a customer to default a loan?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The file distribution on this project is pretty straightforward, the CRISP-DM approach used to analyze the Loan dataset is on the default-loans-eda.ipynb notebook, and the rest of the files are license, readme, gitignore.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The results from this data analysis can be found on this vailable [Post](https://medium.com/@eduardommelgaco/this-data-analysis-will-make-you-rethink-how-loans-are-given-bee93bb8fb87).
